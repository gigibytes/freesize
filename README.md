# freesize

Learning project.

Goal: create a compiled PowerShell cmdlet that can be used in place of tools like TreeSize Free (i.e., view what the biggest files/directories are). Ideally would be interactive (via [TUI](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui)).

- Why F#?
PowerShell is too slow and I want to learn more F#.
